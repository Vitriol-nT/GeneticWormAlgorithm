# Building Genetic Algorithm from Scratch

Hello. This probably is going to be my biggest project ever.
It will involve techniques of Genetic Algorithms.
For now (Aug, 17, 2025) since lack of my skills now
I think it would take me some time to aquire the ones that I need.
The algorithm will be built purely on C++ from scratch.

Finish might be overly delayed because of my Exams.

*I'm guessing it will be about being somewhere around 15 monthes.*


## 1. Utilization
It's primitive now.
In order to use, run app.py and run it on your local host.
For your control, you will use W-A-S-D keys.
If you're keyboard was switched to another language, it wouldn't work.
For example, if your keyboard is set to be Korean, resulting 'WASD' to be 'ㅈㅁㄴㅇ',
it wouldn't be able to read your controls.

(For now it moves literally every direction regardless of the snake's body
or to the wall etc. I know it's just that i didn't put the context of
direction enough in the Module.py but I'll probably fix it on the next update)

## 2. Structure
**Agent1.py**: Agent1 is driven by set of mechanical principles. Without any form of intelligence.
It seeks the closest food it has from the head, and works in very structed forms, which may show limitations
on flexibility or reaching the high scores. Avoids walls, 

**A2.cpp**: Agent2 is DL model. (not yet made)
